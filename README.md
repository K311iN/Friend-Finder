#**Friend-Finder**

###Friend Finder helps you find a frend based on a survey that determines compatibility by answering 10 psychological questions. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

###_The matching is done by computing the difference between each survey response and accumulating these differences. Which ever member on the database has the smallest difference will be presented as the closest match._
