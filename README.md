<h3>Friend Finder helps you find a friend based on a survey that determines compatibility by answering 10 psychological questions. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. Upon submit, the survey answers will be compared to the other people who filled out the survey to see who is the closest match. </h3>

<h3><i>*The matching is done by computing the difference between each survey response and accumulating these differences. Which ever member on the database has the smallest difference will be presented as the closest match.*</i></h3>
